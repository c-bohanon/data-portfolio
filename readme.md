# Data Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Chris Bohanon and welcome to my portfolio. I am a Data Analyst with experience using various tools to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I believe that data is the new oil, and as a data analyst, I have the privilege of extracting valuable insights from it.

I've curated a selection of projects in this portfolio that showcase my skills and expertise as a data analyst. These projects span various use cases, including data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization, and data modeling.

### AAVE v3 Polygon 2023 Dashboard

[SQL Query Directory](https://github.com/c-bohanon/data-portfolio/tree/main/Projects/AAVE%20v3%20Polygon%202023%20Dashboard/queries)

**Purpose:** To create a visualization of performance metrics for the AAVE v3 Polygon pool for the year 2023.

**Description:** This project utilizes Dune, a platform for querying blockchain data. With this platform, I was able to use SQL queries to extract information regarding the individual tokens, user behaviors, and convert crypto financial data into USD. After this, I created a dashboard containing key performance metrics for the year 2023. As one of the largest protocols in the DeFi space, this can give the viewer a snapshot of the sector's performance as well as a time-series analysis for the year.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Advanced SQL (CTEs, Joins, Case Statements, etc.) 

**Tools:** SQL, Dune

**Result:** Detailed and interactive visualization of financial and user information allowing the viewer to intuitively understand many aspects regarding the performance of the protocol on the Polygon blockchain for the year 2023.
The interactive version of this dashboard can be found [here](https://dune.com/c_bohanon/aave-v3-polygon-2023)

### Starbucks Customer Segmentation

[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/c-bohanon/data-portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Starbucks%20Customer%20Segmentation/starbucks_customer_segmentation.ipynb)

**Purpose:** To enhance promotional strategies by analyzing past performance, identifying what customers respond to, and generating customer segments for more targeted promotional offers.

**Description:** In this data analysis project, I explored Starbucks' customer transaction and offer interaction data to gain insights into effective promotional strategies. The objectives were to examine which features influence offer viewership and completion, and to perform customer segmentation based on these factors. I analyzed demographic information, offer characteristics, and created new features before applying the K-Means algorithm for clustering customers.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Data Modeling

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

**Result:** The findings indicated that social media is a significant determinant of offer viewership, but it negatively affects completion rates. Discount offers were - perhaps counterintuitively - more likely to be completed than bogo offers despite having higher difficulties and lower rewards on average. With K-Means clustering, I identified three customer segments: Casual (28% of customers), Curious (48% of customers), and Committed (30% of customers). The Casual segment showed varying rates of viewership and low completion rates, while the Curious segment had high viewership but low completion rates. Committed customer exhibited varying viewership with the highest completion rates. The strategic, data-driven recommendations include improving offer delivery channels for conversions, increasing transaction amounts for Causal customers, and engaging methods to convert Curious customers into Committed ones.

### Credit Card Customer Retention

[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/c-bohanon/data-portfolio/blob/main/Projects/Credit%20Card%20Customer%20Retention/credit_card_customer_retention.ipynb)

**Purpose:** To discover the reasons behind credit card customer attrition, develop a predictive model, and deliver recommendations designed to increase customer retention.

**Description:** The aim of this project was to provide valuable insights, allowing a business manager to address high customer attrition in their consumer credit card portfolio. Through data cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and ensemble learning model building using XGBoost and random forest, I was able to pinpoint the characteristics of customers at risk of leaving and propose strategies to improve overall customer retention.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Data Visualization, Data Modeling

**Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

**Result:** For this particular scenario, the gradient boosting machine outperformed the random forest model in every evaluation metric which included accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The most significant factors influencing customer attrition were related to product engagement, such as total number of transaction, change in transaction count from one quarter to the next, and total spending as a credit card customer.
