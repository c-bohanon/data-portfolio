# Data Science Solutions
<p>The Jupyter Notebooks here are my data science projects aimed at utilizing data to create data-driven business recommendations. The processes involve importing the data and relevant libraries, data wrangling, data analysis and visualizations, feature engineering, and ends with a final data model that provides insights regarding the best solution for a particular problem.</p>
<h4><b>Starbucks Customer Segmentation: A Clustering Analysis</b></h4>  
The goal of this project is to optimize the delivery of promotional offers to customers by utilizing data analysis and Scikit-learn's K-Means clustering. There were 3 separate questions that needed to be answered for relevant strategies to be produced:
<ul>
    <li>What makes an offer effective?</li>
    <li>What gets an offer viewed?</li>
    <li>How are different customers responding to offers and why?</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Credit Card Customer Retention: An Ensemble Learning Analysis</b></h4>
The goal of this project is to investigate the underlying factors behind a common binary classification problem: customer churn. In order to do this, I modeled the data using a random forest and XGBoost, evaluated the models using cross-validation, used the best model to predict on unseen data, and analyzed the resulting feature importance plot to derive data-driven insights to the relevant business problem:
<ul>
    <li>What are the characteristics of churning customers?</li>
</ul>
