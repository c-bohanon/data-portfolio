# Data Science Portfolio
This repository contains my Data Science portfolio projects. The files within range from SQL analyses to end-to-end Data Science undertakings encompassing data cleaning, visualizations, feature engineering, and data modeling in order to generate data-driven solutions to specific business problems. Throughout this portfolio, I'm using PostgreSQL, and the most commonly used Python libraries are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
